            You are writing a new blog post for a software engineering blog focused on engineering leadership, AI & development, systems thinking, and team dynamics.

            CONTEXT:
            - Today is ${{ steps.date_info.outputs.day_of_week }}, ${{ steps.date_info.outputs.month_day }}
            - The blog author is JM, a software engineer passionate about building systems that matter and exploring how technology shapes work
            - Recent topics include: "Hiring Engineers in the AI Era", "Is AI Turning Engineers Into Managers?"
            - Writing style: Professional but conversational, practical insights, real-world applications

            TASK:
            Research and write a new blog post following this exact format:

            ---
            layout: post
            title: "[COMPELLING TITLE HERE]"
            date: ${{ steps.date_info.outputs.today }}
            description: "[BRIEF DESCRIPTION HERE]"
            ---

            [Write a compelling blog post that fits the author's style and topics. The post should be 800-1200 words, include practical insights, and cover current trends in engineering leadership, AI development, or systems thinking. Use markdown formatting with clear headings and engaging content.]

            Focus on topics like:
            - Engineering leadership and team dynamics
            - AI's impact on software development
            - System architecture and scalability
            - Technical career growth
            - Modern development practices

            Make it highly relevant to today's engineering challenges and include specific, actionable insights.
