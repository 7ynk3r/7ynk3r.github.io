- hiring in the ai era:
 * interview: idea of the prompt "given a large repo and large logs file, find and fix problem in 5'". explain the solution and alternatives in detail. use any tools you want. the idea is to solve with ai. the prompt can have additional requirements which the candidate should verify with ai. live coding a smal snipet can be a good idea too for sururcical precision.
 * generalists vs specialist: leaning more into generalists.
 * junior vs senior.
 * remote vs rto
  
- n8n
- mcp
- remote and rto
- Feature velocity is easier to measure than code reliability
