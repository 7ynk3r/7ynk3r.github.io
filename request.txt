I need you to create a new blog post for my Jekyll site. Please:
1. TODAY: @web Search online for today's calendar day. Don't run a command for this.
1. ANALYZE: Read my about.md and recent posts in _posts/ to understand my format, style, and topics
2. RESEARCH: @web Find current trends/news related to my usual subjects
3. CREATE: Generate a new post following my exact format. 
Handle the entire process end-to-end. The post should match my style perfectly.
