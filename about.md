# Who is this human?

I'm JM, a software engineer with a passion for building systems that matter and
exploring how technology shapes the way we work.

## What I Do

I spend my days architecting scalable systems, leading engineering teams, and
navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered development. I've seen
firsthand how tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude are transforming not just how
we write code, but how we think about engineering roles and team dynamics.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share **engineering insights** from building and scaling
systems, **leadership perspectives** on the evolving IC-to-management spectrum,
**AI & development** thoughts on how artificial intelligence is reshaping our
craft, and **practical lessons** from the intersection of technology and team
dynamics.

## Background

I believe the most interesting challenges in tech aren't just technicalâ€”they're
about understanding how people, processes, and technology intersect. Whether
it's designing resilient architectures or helping teams adapt to AI-first
workflows, I'm fascinated by problems that require both technical depth and
human insight.

## Connect

I'd love to hear your thoughts on any of these topics. Feel free to reach out on
